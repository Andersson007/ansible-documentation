Code of Conduct
===============

All communication and interactions in the Ansible Community are governed by our :ref:`code_of_conduct`. Please read and understand it!

.. _ansible_forum:

Forum
=====

The `Ansible Community Forum <https://forum.ansible.com>`_ is a single starting point and our default communication platform for questions and help, development discussions, events, and much more. `Register <https://forum.ansible.com/signup?>`_ to join the community. Search by categories and tags to find interesting topics or start a new one; subscribe only to topics you need!

Take a look at the `forum groups <https://forum.ansible.com/g>`_ and join ones that match your interests.
In most cases, joining a forum group automatically subscribes you to related posts.

.. _communication_irc:

Real-time chat
==============

For real-time interactions, conversations in the Ansible community happen over the Matrix protocol.

.. note::

  The :ref:`ansible_forum` is our default communication platform. Join the forum and get in touch with the community there before considering other options like Matrix.

Join a channel any time to chat with fellow enthusiasts, participate in a Working Group meeting, or just say hello. To chat on Matrix, you need:

* a Matrix account (from `Matrix.org <https://app.element.io/#/register>`_ or any other Matrix homeserver)
* a `Matrix client <https://matrix.org/clients/>`_ (we recommend `Element Webchat <https://app.element.io>`_)

The room links in the :ref:`general_channels` or the :ref:`working_group_list` list will take you directly to the relevant rooms.

For more information, see the community-hosted `Matrix FAQ <https://hackmd.io/@ansible-community/community-matrix-faq>`_.

You can add Matrix shields to your repository's ``README.md`` using the shield in the `community-topics <https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics#community-topics>`_ repository as a template.

.. note::

  IRC channels are no longer considered official communication channels. Please use the Forum and Matrix instead.

General channels
----------------

The clickable links will take you directly to the relevant Matrix room in your browser; room/channel information is also given for use in other clients:

- `Community social room and posting news for the Bullhorn newsletter <https://matrix.to:/#/#social:ansible.com>`_
- `General usage and support questions <https://matrix.to:/#/#users:ansible.com>`_
- `Discussions on developer topics and code related to features or bugs <https://matrix.to/#/#devel:ansible.com>`_ 
- `Discussions on community and collections related topics <https://matrix.to:/#/#community:ansible.com>`_
- `For public community meetings <https://matrix.to/#/#meeting:ansible.im>`_

Working group-specific channels
-------------------------------

Many of the working groups have dedicated chat channels. See the :ref:`working_group_list` for more information.

Meetings on Matrix
------------------

The Ansible community holds regular meetings on various topics on Matrix, and anyone who is interested is invited to participate.
For more information about Ansible meetings, consult the `meeting schedule and agenda page <https://github.com/ansible-community/meetings/blob/main/README.md>`_.

.. _working_group_list:

Working groups
==============

Working Groups are a way for Ansible community members to self-organize around particular topics of interest.

Our community working groups are represented in `Forum groups <https://forum.ansible.com/g>`.
See those links for a complete list of communications channels.

Requesting a forum group
--------------------------

To request a new working group:

* Check if there is no appropriate `Forum group <https://forum.ansible.com/g>`_ you can join instead of starting a new one.
* See the `things you can ask for <https://forum.ansible.com/t/working-groups-things-you-can-ask-for/175>`_ with respect to working groups.
* Request a group in the `forum topic <https://forum.ansible.com/t/requesting-a-forum-group/503>`.
* If you also need a Matrix chat channel, see the `Ansible Community Matrix FAQ <https://hackmd.io/@ansible-community/community-matrix-faq#How-do-I-create-a-public-community-room>`_.

.. _request_coll_repo:

Requesting a community collection repository
--------------------------------------------

Working groups are often built around Ansible community collections. You can use a repository under your organization or request one under `ansible-collections <https://github.com/ansible-collections>`_ on the forum by creating a topic in the `Project Discussions category and the coll-repo-request tag <https://forum.ansible.com/new-topic?category=project&tags=coll-repo-request>`_.

.. _community_topics:

Ansible Community Topics
========================

The :ref:`Ansible Community Steering Committee<steering_responsibilities>` uses the :ref:`ansible_forum` to asynchronously discuss with the Community and vote on Community topics.

Create a `new topic <https://forum.ansible.com/new-topic?category=project&tags=community-wg>`_ if you want to discuss an idea that impacts any of the following:

* Ansible Community
* Community collection best practices and :ref:`requirements<collections_requirements>`
* :ref:`Community collection inclusion policy<steering_inclusion>`
* :ref:`The Community governance<steering_responsibilities>`
* Other proposals of importance that need the Committee or overall Ansible community attention

See the `Community topics workflow <https://forum.ansible.com/new-topic?category=project&tags=community-wg>`_ to learn more.

Ansible Automation Platform support questions
=============================================

Red Hat Ansible `Automation Platform <https://www.ansible.com/products/automation-platform>`_ is a subscription that contains support, certified content, and tooling for Ansible including content management, a controller, UI and REST API.

If you have a question about Ansible Automation Platform, visit `Red Hat support <https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-ansible-automation-platform/>`_ rather than using a chat channel or the general project mailing list.

The Bullhorn
============

**The Bullhorn** is our newsletter for the Ansible contributor community. You can get Bullhorn updates
from the :ref:`ansible_forum`.

If you have any questions or content you would like to share, you are welcome to chat with us
in the `Ansible Social room on Matrix<https://matrix.to/#/#social:ansible.com>, and mention
`newsbot <https://matrix.to/#/@newsbot:ansible.im>`_ to have your news item tagged for review for 
the next weekly issue.

Read past issues of `the Bullhorn <https://forum.ansible.com/c/news/bullhorn/17>`_.
